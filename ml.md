### What is Machine Learning?
- AI is the broad capability of machines to perform tasks using human-like intelligence.
- ML, a subset of AI, enables computers to learn from data and improve without explicit programming.

### Types of Machine Learning
- **Supervised Learning**: Training with labeled data to predict outcomes.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Identifying patterns and distributions without labeled outputs.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Models learn to maximize rewards through trial and error, similar to training a pet.

### How is Machine Learning Different from Traditional Programming?
- Traditional problem-solving requires explicit programming and detailed analysis.
- Machine learning automates pattern recognition and adapts to data, making it more flexible and efficient.
- Example: Writing a program to detect cats in images is complex with traditional methods but streamlined with ML.

### Traditional Programming vs. Machine Learning
- In traditional programming, solutions are explicitly coded to address problems.
- In machine learning, a model is created and trained using data to predict outcomes beyond the initial dataset.
- ML automates statistical reasoning and pattern-matching.

### Stages in Machine Learning
1. **Model Creation**: The initial framework or code representing potential solutions.
2. **Model Training Algorithm**: Adjusts model parameters based on data to achieve specific goals.
3. **Model Inference Algorithm**: Uses the trained model to make predictions or solve real-world problems.

### Example of How ML is Used
- A machine learning model is a flexible program shaped by data, used to solve specific problems.
- It undergoes training to adjust parameters, enabling it to make predictions effectively.

### Model Training Algorithms
- Model training involves an interactive process:
  1. **Inspection**: Evaluating the raw model and planning necessary changes.
  2. **Modification**: Adjusting the model to better meet the goal.
  3. **Iteration**: Repeating the process to refine the model until satisfactory results are achieved.
