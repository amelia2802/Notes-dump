### What is Machine Learning?
- AI is the broad capability of machines to perform tasks using human-like intelligence.
- ML, a subset of AI, enables computers to learn from data and improve without explicit programming.

### Types of Machine Learning
- **Supervised Learning**: Training with labeled data to predict outcomes.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Identifying patterns and distributions without labeled outputs.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Models learn to maximize rewards through trial and error, similar to training a pet.

### How is Machine Learning Different from Traditional Programming?
- Traditional problem-solving requires explicit programming and detailed analysis.
- Machine learning automates pattern recognition and adapts to data, making it more flexible and efficient.
- Example: Writing a program to detect cats in images is complex with traditional methods but streamlined with ML.

### Traditional Programming vs. Machine Learning
- In traditional programming, solutions are explicitly coded to address problems.
- In machine learning, a model is created and trained using data to predict outcomes beyond the initial dataset.
- ML automates statistical reasoning and pattern-matching.

### Stages in Machine Learning
1. **Model Creation**: The initial framework or code representing potential solutions.
2. **Model Training Algorithm**: Adjusts model parameters based on data to achieve specific goals.
3. **Model Inference Algorithm**: Uses the trained model to make predictions or solve real-world problems.

### Example of How ML is Used
- A machine learning model is a flexible program shaped by data, used to solve specific problems.
- It undergoes training to adjust parameters, enabling it to make predictions effectively.

### Model Training Algorithms
- Model training involves an interactive process:
  1. **Inspection**: Evaluating the raw model and planning necessary changes.
  2. **Modification**: Adjusting the model to better meet the goal.
  3. **Iteration**: Repeating the process to refine the model until satisfactory results are achieved.

### Steps in Machine Learning

#### Step 1: Define a Specific Problem
- Begin with a precise question, such as whether an upcharge increases snow cone sales, instead of a broad question like "How do I increase sales?"

#### Step 2: Identify the Machine Learning Task
- Choose between **Supervised Learning** (using labeled data) and **Unsupervised Learning** (using unlabeled data).

#### Step 3: Understand the Data Needed for Training
- **Labeled Data**: Contains solutions or labels (e.g., predicting the number of snow cones sold using temperature data).
- **Unlabeled Data**: Lacks solutions or labels (e.g., identifying images of trees or clustering books by microgenres).

### Machine Learning Tasks

#### Supervised Learning
- **Classification**: Predicting categorical labels (e.g., identifying the type of flower from images).
- **Regression**: Predicting numerical values (e.g., the number of snow cones sold based on temperature).

#### Unsupervised Learning
- **Clustering**: Grouping data points based on natural similarities (e.g., grouping books by microgenres).

### The Four Aspects of Working with Data

#### Data Collection
- Methods range from simple SQL queries to complex web scraping.
- Essential question: Does the collected data match the defined machine learning task and problem?

#### Data Inspection
- Critical for ensuring high-quality data, affecting model performance.
- Check for outliers, missing values, and data that needs transformation or preprocessing.

#### Summary Statistics
- Use statistical tools to align data with model assumptions.
- Calculate metrics like mean, inner-quartile range (IQR), and standard deviation to understand dataset characteristics.

#### Data Visualization
- Helps identify outliers and trends.
- Useful for stakeholder communication through graphs and plots.
